# About Required Workplace Postings

Road Warrior Creative recognizes that employees need to understand their protected individual rights under State and Federal Law. Since our company is distributed (i.e. we do not maintain a physical office space), employees can find all postings and notices in the "Road Warriors" company hub on Basecamp, listed under "Docs & Files" > "Employee Documents".

Please note that Federal posters and notices apply to **all** employees, while State posters and notices apply to **only** employees that reside there.

Road Warrior Creative is posting these notices in compliance with State and Federal Law. Employees with questions or concerns, please contact Chris Hinds, COO._
