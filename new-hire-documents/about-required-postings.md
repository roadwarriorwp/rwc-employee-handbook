# About Required Workplace Postings

Road Warrior Creative recognizes that employees need to understand their protected individual rights under State and Federal Law. Since our company is distributed, employees can find all postings and notices in the "Road Warriors" company hub on Basecamp, listed under "Docs & Files" > "Employee Documents". Employees can also access notices directly by clicking the links below. (Note: You must have a working Basecamp account with access to the "Road Warriors" company hub.)

Please note that Federal posters and notices apply to **all** employees, while State posters and notices apply to **only** employees that reside there.
