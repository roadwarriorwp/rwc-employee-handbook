# Equipment Policy

## Issuing & Returning Equipment

While working for Road Warrior Creative, employees are required to take proper care of all company property that they have been entrusted with. The employee's supervisor or a company officer will log all issued pieces of company property on the Xero Employee Portal, under the file of the applicable employee. At the end of their employment, employees are required return all property of Road Warrior Creative that they were issued in proper working order. This policy applies to the item(s) listed as available for procurement below, in addition to any other property acquired by the Company and issued to the employee. 

Road Warrior Creative equipment is expected to have a minimum lifespan of 4 years. Company equipment that is less than 4 years old and still in proper working order will not be considered for replacement. Road Warrior Creative reserves the right to keep equipment in rotation longer than 4 years, if the equipment still meets the needs of the company and individual employee.

Should an employee accidentally damage company property, they should immediately notify their supervisor or a company officer. Employees will never be liable for accidental damage to company property. Damaged equipment that has been reported will be replaced in a timely manner at the company's expense.

Should an employee deliberately damage, destroy or sabotage company property, Road Warrior Creative will consider this an act of vandalism and may choose to criminally prosecute the employee.

Should an employee fail to return equipment they were issued, Road Warrior Creative will consider this an act of theft and may choose to criminally prosecute the employee.

## Equipment Procurement List

Equipment available for procurement has been divided into three categories: "All Employees", "Technical Employees" and "Non-Technical Employees". Due to the different demands of roles within our company, Road Warrior Creative recognizes that different tools are needed for the job. Please review the procurement list below. If you would like to be issued company equipment for which you are eligible, please contact Chris Hinds, COO. We reserve the right to make substitutions on procurement requests, as needed.

(Note: If you are a contractor, we are not able to issue you company owned equipment.)
