# Salary and Equity Compensation Policy

## Salary Compensation

Fair compensation is critical to making Road Warrior Creative a desirable place to work and is a key component of helping our employees to lead happy, healthy lives inside and outside of the office. However, we believe that salary is just _one_ of many components that makes a job rewarding. The majority of positions at Road Warrior Creative allow employees work from anywhere with an internet connection. This is a __major__ perk. Here's why:

* The vast majority of jobs require you to commute to an office or job site. We think that this sucks!
* Remote jobs give you thousands of dollars and dozens of hours of your life back _per year_, by eliminating your commute.
* Traditional "two car" families can potentially save thousands more by dropping the extra car (and car payment).
* For those that like frequent changes of scenery, you can do your job from just about any coffee shop or library that has WiFi.
* For those that love to travel, you can work anywhere with 4-G + data coverage.
* Say goodbye to being micromanaged: As long as your work is done well and on-schedule, we prefer to maintain a "hands off" approach.
* Working from home with a flexible schedule is more family and pet friendly.

For every employee, compensation begins with a reasonable base salary that is designed to check the box of "enough" for individuals already excited about working remotely. To better align the motivations of our employees, we have a standard rubric that determines compensation for all employees. All full-time Road Warrior Creative employees fall into one of six options based on their job description and years of past experience, as detailed in the next section.

## Hourly Employee Information:

Hourly positions at Road Warrior Creative are typically entry-level. While important to our success, these positions typically do not require as much experience or specialized training. Hourly rates are calculated on a per-case basis based upon the position's requirements, individual experience, geographic location, and publicly available wage data.

Hourly positions include: Operations Assistant, Intern

## Employee Salary Table:

Salaried positions at Road Warrior Creative are divided into "Technical" and "Non-Technical" roles.

**Technical** - A position that requires specific knowledge or skills which can only be applied to that field or area of work and represent a specialty or focus. Technical positions may include: Developer, Technical Support Lead, Digital Strategist

**Non-Technical** - A position that requires general knowledge or skills that have a broad range of applications and do not represent a specialty or focus. Non-technical positions may include: Project Manager, Graphic Designer, Digital Content Specialist

Experience | Technical | Non-Technical
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Less Than 2 Years | $50,000 | $35,000
2-5 Years | $60,000 | $45,000
More Than 5 Years | $70,000 | $55,000
Salary Cap | $80,000 | $65,000

We count experience as any time doing the same category of job at a company similar to Road Warrior Creative, such that the experience is relevant to the job being offered.

In addition to base salary, employees may have the opportunity to earn profit-based incentive bonuses.

## Annual Cost-of-Living Adjustment:

Every January, all employees who held their current position for at least 180 days leading up to the new year will receive an annual cost of living adjustment tied to the average inflation of the previous calendar year, as reported by the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI). Adjustments will cap at 3.5% per-year and will be waived for any year in which the CPI reports inflation as a negative percentage. Any employee who has reached the salary cap for their position (as shown in the Employee Salary Table) will no longer be eligible for these adjustments.

## Annual Incentive Bonus Plan:

This annual incentive bonus plan is designed to provide additional incentive-based compensation to eligible employees of Road Warrior Creative. In order for bonuses to be distributed, the total bonus pool must not exceed 40% of Road Warrior Creative's estimated profits after tax and distributions for the calendar year (Calculated the following March). In the event that this requirement is not met, Road Warrior Creative may, in its sole discretion, choose to either __(a)__ Distribute no bonuses. OR __(b)__ Adjust bonuses such that the total adjusted bonus pool meets the 40% requirement described above.

To be eligible for the annual incentive bonus, the following must be true at the time bonuses are distributed:

* You are a full-time employee of the company.
* You held your current position for at least 90 days during the calendar year for which bonsuses are being distributed.
* Your job performance is considered to be in good standing.

Bonuses are computed as a percentage of wages or base salary received as of year-end. Bonus payments will be made no later than April 30th of the following year. The payment will be taxed at the flat Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rate, plus applicable state rates for bonus payments. In order to incentivize long-term stays with Road Warrior Creative, the following bonus structure will be used:

Time With Company | % of Wages/Salary
------------ | -------------
Less Than 2 Years | 5.0%
2-5 Years | 10.0%
More Than 5 Years | 15.0%

As can be seen, using this method gives every employee a comfortable "base" salary tied to experience and the technical challenges of their position, with regular adjustments for cost of living built in. The remainder of their compensation is tied directly to business profit and length of time with the company. At Road Warrior Creative, weâ€™re hoping to build a loyal team that grows with us, and we believe sharing a substantial portion of our profits with employees is the best way to accomplish that. 

**Note:** _Company officers' compensation does not follow this rubric, as all company officers are given an ownership stake in Road Warrior Creative and paid substantially lower annual salaries + reasonable owner's draws._

## Equity Compensation

Currently only Road Warrior Creative officers are allowed to own equity in the company. Equity is currently represented as blanket percentage ownership only. Here are the current officer positions and the equity percentage associated with each:

* Amber Hinds, Creative Director / CEO - 55% Equity
* Christopher Hinds, Chief Operations Officer - 45% Equity

### _Other Considerations_

_At the beginning of each year (in January), we will adjust and update this document to ensure that it continues to align with the interests of both employees and the company, and to ensure that the identity of company officers and distribution of equity is accurately reflected._
