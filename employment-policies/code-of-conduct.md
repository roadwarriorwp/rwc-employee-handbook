#Code of Conduct Policy

This code of conduct applies to Road Warrior Creative employees and contractors in all capacities where they represent or can be affliated with our company, including:

* Road Warrior Creative online communities and platforms, including but not limited to 
	* Internal platforms such as Basecamp, GitHub, WordPress.org, and Zendesk
	* Social media sites such as Facebook, Google Plus, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitter, and YouTube
* In locations or during events that Road Warrior Creative rents, sponsors, or attends in an official capacity
* And wherever an employee publicly associates themselves with our company.

## Purpose

Road Warrior Creative is commited to creating an inclusive environment for everyone - both employees and clients - regardless of race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, political affiliation, disbility, or any other protected class as defined by state and federal law.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for employee behavior as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.  We invite all employees to help us realize a safe and positive experience for everyone on our team and all people with whom we professionally and publically engage.

## Expected Behavior

1. Be professional, considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
2. Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior and speech.
3. Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow human beings. 
4. Participate in Road Warrior Creative's business growth and engage with our clients in an authentic and active way.
5. Respect all licenses and copyrights, providing appropriate attribution where needed.
5. Alert your supervisor or a Road Warrior Creative officer if you notice an inappropriate situation or someone in distress.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct by any employee of Road Warrior Creative. 

Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of work or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.  Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstance.

A supplemental goal of this code of conduct is to emphasize the importance of following all licenses and copyrights as required by law and common courtesy. Theft or lack of attribution when required of text, images, or code is unacceptable.

## Consequences Of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated whether by employees, officers, or clients of Road Warrior Creative.  Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If an employee engages in unacceptable behavior, Road Warrior Creative's officers or the employee's direct supervisor may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including suspension without pay or immediate dismissal.

## What To Do If You Witness Or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behavior

If you are subject to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else is being subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify an officer of Road Warrior Creative immediately, following the procedures outlined in the [Employee Complaints Policy](https://github.com/roadwarriorwp/rwc-employee-handbook/blob/master/employment-policies/employee-complaints.md)
