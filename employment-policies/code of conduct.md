#Code of Conduct Policy

This code of conduct applies to Road Warrior Creative team members in all Road Warrior Creative online communities and platforms (including but not limited to: Basecamp, Zendesk, Slack, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, and Google +), in locations or events that Road Warrior Creative rents, sponsors, or attends in an official capacity, and wherever an employee publicly associates themselves with our company.

Our community is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, color, sex, national origin, age, disability (physical or mental), genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and political affiliation as well as gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, or physical appearance. Consider that calling attention to differences can feel alienating.

We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to the protected classes above, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstance.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an officer of Road Warrior Creative immediately.
