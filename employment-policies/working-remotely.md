# Remote Work Policy

Working remotely has a lot of advantages, but also a couple of challenges. The goal of this section is to provide information and tips to maximize the advantages and make you aware of the challenges and provide tips on how to deal with them.

Probably the biggest advantage of working remotely is the flexibility it provides. This makes it easy to combine work with your personal life, although for some it might be difficult to find the right balance. This can be mitigated by either explicitly planning your time off or explicitly planning when you do work, and making those plans clear to co-workers, family and friends. When you don't work, it is recommended to make yourself unavailable by disabling all notifications and closing down your email client. 

If you have worked at an office before, now you lack a default group to go out to lunch with. To look at it from a different perspective, now you can select who you lunch with and who you do not lunch with. Haven't spoken to a good friend in a while? Now you can have lunch together!

## Establishing a Work Schedule

All employees are required to have at least 75% of their work time scheduled, so that management knows the best time(s) to contact and collaborate with each employee. Having scheduled coverage is especially important for employees that handle support and client communications, which typically take place during normal business hours across all US time zones. *The remaining 25% of work time can take place whenever the employee would like it to.* 

Schedules must be mutually agreed upon in advance by the employee and his/her direct supervisor. In the event that work quality suffers or deadlines are not being met, an employee may be asked to schedule up to 100% of their work time. 

We prefer not to micro-manage employee scheduling and task prioritization. 

## Acceptable Work Locations

Employees are welcome to work from any location that is most appealing to them on any given day, providing that there is a reliable, high-speed internet connection and that the space is relatively distraction free.  We recognize that "distraction free" means different things to different people, and that's OK!  We trust each employee to work in a place that will be most conducive to his/her productivity.

Employees who would like to work in a coffee shop or cafe are eligible to participate in our [Coffee Break Allowance Perk](https://github.com/roadwarriorwp/rwc-employee-handbook/blob/master/benefits-and-perks/coffee-break-allowance.md).

If employees will be participating in client phone calls, it is expected that their work locations be free of loud or unprofessional background noises, for example barking dogs, crying babies, or loud music.  If the employee will be participating in video chats with clients, not only should there be minimal background noises, but s/he should also orient his/her seat and camera so that it can be reasonably construed that the employee is working in an office environment.  (I.e. The employee should sit in front of a blank wall rather than with his/her back to a cafe or home living room.)

## Socializing on "Road Warriors" Basecamp Hub

Basecamp is the primary way in which we handle communication within our team. Top-and-center on your Basecamp dashboard is the "Road Warriors" hub, which is where we encourage everyone to go and connect with other employees and contractors.

Understanding that working remotely leads to mostly work-related conversations with your fellow team members, everyone is encouraged to spend some time chatting casually in the "Road Warriors" Basecamp Hub - __get to know who you work with, talk about everyday things and share a virtual coffee break.__ This is critical to preserving the human element that we can sometimes lose when working remotely. Take time to build rapport with the people you work with either in the company "Campfire" or using Basecamp's "ping" function to have one-to-one chats.

## Regular Meetings

Weekly, we will have regular team meetings to discuss project status and ongoing priorities.  Preferably these team meetings will take place via Google Hangouts or Zoom video conferences, which allows us to connect face-to-face and share screens as needed.  Between team meetings, employees are encouraged to connect via video chat if a meeting or larger discussion is needed than can be had through Basecamp.  While productivity is important, it's also important to reserve a little time for personal connection and pleasantries.
