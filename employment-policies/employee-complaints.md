#Employee Complaint Policy

Road Warrior Creative is committed to creating a safe work environment that is free of threats to the health, safety, and well-being of the people who work with us. That includes (but isn’t limited to) harassment, discrimination, violation of health and safety rules, and violence.

Road Warrior Creative has an open-door policy, so employees are encouraged to report work-related concerns. If something about your job is bothering you, or if you have a question, concern, idea, or problem related to your work, please discuss it with your direct supervisor as soon as possible. If for any reason you don’t feel comfortable discussing it with them, feel free to raise the issue with an officer of the company.

Any employee who witnesses or is subject to inappropriate conduct in the workplace can report it to their direct supervisor or any of the officers of the company. We encourage employees to come forward with any workplace complaint, even if it’s not about something that’s explicitly covered in our written policies.

Once a complaint has been made, the company's officers will meet and determine how to handle it. If one or more of the company's officers is the subject of the complaint, the remaining officer(s) will determine how to handle it. Any reports of an officer engaging in harassment or gross misconduct will trigger an outside investigator. With the employee’s permission, we will conduct a complete and impartial investigation, which may involve an outside investigator in serious cases. All complaints will be handled as confidentially as possible. When the investigation is complete, the company will take corrective action, if appropriate.

We will not engage in or allow retaliation against any employee who makes a good faith complaint or participates in an investigation. If you believe that you are being subjected to any kind of negative treatment because you made or were questioned about a complaint, report the conduct immediately to an officer of the company.

Currently, Road Warrior Creative is too small to have an internal group or department that can independently respond to complaints, so if company officer(s) are named in complaints, they will do their best to hold one another accountable. Where appropriate, the officers will engage a third party to conduct a thorough investigation and recommend corrective action, where necessary.
