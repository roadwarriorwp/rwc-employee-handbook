# Drug and Alcohol Policy

Our priority at Road Warrior Creative is to promote a safe, comfortable, and productive environment for everyone we work with. We realize that drugs and alcohol can contribute to a culture of harassment or one that feels unsafe for some employees, even as it can foster camaraderie and friendship among others. Above all other considerations, our drug and alcohol policy is intended to preempt and avoid harassment and make work at Road Warrior Creative feel safe.

Alcohol in the form of beer, wine, or liquor may occasionally be consumed to celebrate an accomplishment, birthday, or other milestones in locations or during events that Road Warrior Creative rents, sponsors, or attends in an official capacity, however it is the responsibility of every employee to ensure that his/her individual consumption is not making anyone else feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Employees who violate this policy will be required to immediately discuss such violations with their direct supervisor, and depending upon severity may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including suspension without pay or immediate dismissal.

For the health and safety of our employees, all Road Warrior Creative events and locations are non-smoking, and the use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, vaporizers, and pipes, etc. are strictly forbidden.  This includes the consumption of marijuana.

Illegal drugs should not be used, bought, sold, or distributed in locations or during events that Road Warrior Creative rents, sponsors, or attends in an official capacity, or anywhere outside of such location(s) while representing Road Warrior Creative.
