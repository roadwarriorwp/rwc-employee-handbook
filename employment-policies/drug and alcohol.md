#Drug and Alcohol Policy

Our priority at Road Warrior Creative is to promote a safe, comfortable, and productive environment for everyone we work with. We realize that drugs and alcohol can contribute to a culture of harassment or one that feels unsafe for some employees, even as it can foster camaraderie and friendship among others. Above all other considerations, our drug and alcohol policy is intended to preempt and avoid harassment and make work at Road Warrior Creative feel safe.

It is the responsibility of every employee to ensure that their individual consumption is not making anyone else feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Employees who violate this policy will be required to immediately discuss such violations with their direct supervisor, and depending upon severity may be subject to immediate separation. Alcohol in the form of beer or wine may occasionally be consumed to celebrate an accomplishment, birthday, or other milestones in locations or events that Road Warrior Creative rents, sponsors, or attends in an official capacity. 

Illegal drugs should not be used, bought, sold, or distributed in locations or events that Road Warrior Creative rents, sponsors, or attends in an official capacity, or anywhere outside of such location(s) while representing Road Warrior Creative.
