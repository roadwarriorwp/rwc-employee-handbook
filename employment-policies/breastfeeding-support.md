# Breastfeeding Support for Employees

In recognition of the health advantages of breastfeeding for infants and mothers, Road Warrior Creative is committed to providing a supportive environment for breastfeeding employees during work hours. Our policy for breastfeeding support is outlined below.

## Company Responsibilities

### Time For Milk Expression

Employees who are breastfeeding may express milk or breastfeed during their work hours, using their normal break(s) or meal time(s). In cases where extra time is needed, employees may negotiate make-up time with their supervisor or use PTO.

### A Place to Express Milk

A private room (not a toilet stall or restroom) will be available to employees working at Road Warrior Creative's main office in Georgetown, TX. The room will be private and sanitary. Additionally, the employee will have access to a sink with running water for washing their hands and breast pump equipment. Employees at Road Warrior Creative's main office may store expressed milk in the refridgerator located in our building's shared kitchen, which sees limited use. Employees that are working from home may, of course, breastfeed or express/store milk in whatever fashion they are most comfortable.

### Breastfeeding Equipment

Employees that are enrolled in a health insurance plan with Road Warrior Creative may be eligible for subsidized or free breast pumps, depending on their individual coverage. We strongly recommend that employees contact a representative with our group insurance provider for the most up-to-date information.

### Staff Support

Company officers and supervisors are responsible for alerting pregnant and breastfeeding employees regarding this policy and to follow through on the company's obligations as outlined above. In addition, all other staff members are expected to provide a positive and supportive atmosphere for breastfeeding employees.

## Employee Responsibilities

### Communication With Supervisors

Employees who wish to express milk or breastfeed during work hours should keep their supervisor informed of their needs so that accommodations can be made to satisfy the needs of both the employee and the company.

### Milk Expression Areas

Our office's main conference room (which has a lockable door and window blinds) is the designated milk expression area for on-site employees. We ask that breastfeeding employees please keep the conference room clean, using antimicrobial spray and microfiber towels (supplied by company) when necessary. Remote employees may breastfeed or express milk within the comfort of their own homes and are solely responsible for the cleanliness and safety of their home environment.

### Milk Storage

Employees should label all milk expressed with their name and the date it was collected so that it is not inadvertently confused with another employee's milk. Each employee is responsible for proper storage of her milk. If employees are concerned regarding the use of a shared refrigerator, the employee may also keep a small cooler or other sealed container with their name on it inside the refrigerator to provide an extra barrier.

### Shared Use

We ask that employees try, to the best of their ability, to plan milk expression times around client meetings and internal team meetings, which also make use of the conference room. If an employee is experiencing discomfort due to the need to express milk and the conference room is under extended use, on-site staff can also temporarily vacate the main office room for 15-20 minutes to create an alternative private space.
