# Dress Code

One of the great benefits of working remotely is there is no dress code!  Whether you start your day getting dressed in your professional best or prefer to work in your pajamas, we encourage each employee to do what works best for him or her.  

There are three exceptions to Road Warrior Creative's non-dress code policy, outlined below.

## Team Meetings/Video Chats

When participating in team meetings or video chats with other employees, the dress code is simple: wear clothes and keep in mind our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/roadwarriorwp/rwc-employee-handbook/blob/master/employment-policies/code-of-conduct.md).  Employees should not dress in a way which could make other employees feel uncomfortable or harrassed.

## Client Meetings/Video Chats

When engaging with clients in person or via video chats, employees must present themselves and Road Warrior Creative professionally.  For video chats and most meetings business casual attire is acceptable.  Appropriate business casual clothing typically includes slacks or khakis, a dress shirt, blouse, or polo shirt, a dress or skirt at knee-length or below, a blazer or sweater, and loafers or dress shoes that cover all or most of the foot.  In most cases, comfortably fitted, non-ripped jeans are also acceptable.

During sales pitch meetings, it may be necessary for employees to dress in business-professional attire.  This will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.

## At Public Events/Conferences

When representing Road Warrior Creative at public events, meetups, workshops, and/or conferences, employees are expected to respect the dress code policies/norms of each specific event or venue.  Some venues or conferences, such as Chamber of Commerce events, may require business casual or business professional dress, wheras others, such as WordPress meetups and WordCamps, are far less formal.
