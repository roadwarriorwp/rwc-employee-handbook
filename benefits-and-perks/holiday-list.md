Road Warrior Creative will be closed for business on the dates listed below. All employees will receive paid leave during these date(s). Paid time off (PTO) for Federal holidays is provided _in addition_ to regular PTO benefits.

Please note that we occasionally observe Federal Holidays on different dates in order to accommodate a more family-friendly work schedule:

We recognize that our employees may not personally observe the Christmas holiday. Employees may (upon request) reallocate their paid leave on Christmas Day in order to observe an alternative holiday, either religious or non-religious. 

* January 1, 2022 (the legal public holiday for New Year's Day), falls on a Saturday. In accordance with our policy to generally follow federal holiday schedules, Friday, December 31, 2021 will be treated as the 2022 New Year's Day holiday for pay and leave purposes.
