# Coffee Break Allowance

For employees that would like to spend time working in their local coffee shop or cafe each week, __Road Warrior Creative will buy your first coffee, tea, infused water, or smoothie__.

We'll reimburse employees for one non-alcoholic beverage (up to $10) per week, 52 weeks per year, that you consume while working outside the home. For all you math nerds, that's up to $520 worth of caffeine per employee, per year. Employees must submit an itemized receipt on their employee dashboard in Xero within 30 days of purchase, in order to claim reimbursement.
