# Employee Absences

## Non-Protected Absences

Employees of Road Warrior Creative are expected to report to work on time and to avoid unnecessary absences. We understand that there may be times when employees must miss work. However, frequent absenteeism or frequent tardiness puts an unnecessary strain on the company, and therefore employees may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

In the event of absence or tardiness, employees shall provide their manager with as much advance notice as possible. 

Employees that will be absent more than one day will need to notify your manager or director each day of absence. Employees that do not call to notify their manager for three consecutively scheduled work days will be considered to have abandoned their positions and voluntarily separated from Road Warrior Creative.

## Protected Absences

The following absences are considered protected:

* Claims for Paid Time Off (PTO) that are made at least one (1) business day in advance and approved by the employee's supervisor. 
* Absences excused by the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), or Civil Rights Act (Title VII).
* Time missed to attend court-mandated jury duty or other court-mandated appearance(s).
* Time missed for military leave as excused by Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).
* Time missed due to being directly impacted by natural disaster(s) or electricity/internet outage(s).

## Other Leaves of Absence

Road Warrior Creative will grant leaves of absence for other activities as required by law. Unless otherwise required by law or by Road Warrior Creative's company policy, employees will not be paid for non-protected absences.
