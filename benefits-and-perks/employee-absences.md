#Employee Absences

##Non-Protected Absences

Request and approval of non-protected absences will be handled on a per-case basis between the employee and his/her direct supervisor. 

Employees that miss work either without notice or without an adequate/reasonable explanation, will be immediately asked to clarify such an absence with their supervisor. If the employee does not clarify the nature of their absence or if their explanation is deemed unsatisfactory by their supervisor, the employee may be subject to immediate separation.

##Protected Absences

The following absences are considered protected:

* Claims for Paid Time Off (PTO) that are made at least one (1) business day in advance and approved by the employee's supervisor. 
* Absences excused by the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), or Civil Rights Act (Title VII).
* Time missed to attend court-mandated jury duty or other court-mandated appearance(s).
* Time missed for military leave as excused by Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).
* Time missed due to being directly impacted by natural disaster(s) or electricity/internet outage(s).

##Other Leaves of Absence

Road Warrior Creative will grant leaves of absence for other activities as required by law. Unless otherwise required by law or by Road Warrior Creative's company policy, employees will not be paid for non-protected absences.
