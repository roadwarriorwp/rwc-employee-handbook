#Referral Bonuses

##New Hire Referrals

__NOTE:__ *Employees with an ownership stake in Road Warrior Creative are not eligible for this bonus.*

Referrals from people who already work at Road Warrior Creative are one of the best signals we can get about whether or not a candidate will be successful. Our employees understand Road Warrior Creative's needs and what it’s like to work here better than anyone, and their relationship with the candidate means they know a lot more than we can learn during an interview process.

We offer a $1,000.00 referral bonus for any new hire that comes from an employee referral. The referral date can’t be earlier than the date the job is posted and the hiring of the referred employee has to happen within 45 days of the initial referral. The referral must also represent the candidate’s first contact with Road Warrior Creative, and only the first employee to refer a candidate can get the bonus. The referrer should send the candidate’s information to Chris Hinds, COO, should make an introduction to the candidate, and should expect to be engaged lightly during the recruiting and interview process. The referring employee must still be employed by Road Warrior Creative during the hired candidate’s first 30 days of employment.

New hire referral bonuses will be paid within 90 day(s) of the referred employee's first day.

##New Client Referrals

__NOTE:__ *Employees with an ownership stake in Road Warrior Creative and employees whose job descriptions are focused on sales and/or aquiring new business are not eligible for this bonus.*

While we certainly do not expect all of our employees to be door-to-door salespeople, Road Warrior Creative does want to show its appreciation for employees that go above and beyond by directly referring us new clients. 

For new client referrals, we offer a referral bonus equal to 10% of the value of their first invoice, up to a maximum total bonus of $500.00. The new client must engage Road Warrior Creative for paid services within 30 days of the initial referral. The referral must also represent the new client's first contact with Road Warrior Creative and only the first employee to refer a new client can get the bonus. The employee should send the referral's information to Chris Hinds, COO, should make an introduction to the referral, and should expect to be engaged lightly throughout the new client onboarding process. The referring employee must still be employed by Road Warrior Creative on the date that the new client's first invoice is paid in full. 

New client referral bonuses will be paid within 90 day(s) of the new client's first invoice being paid in full.
