# Referral Bonuses

## New Hire Referrals

__NOTE:__ *Employees with an ownership stake in Road Warrior Creative are not eligible for this bonus.*

Support from a current employee is one of the best signals as to whether or not prospect candidates will be successful at our company. Our employees understand Road Warrior Creative's needs and what it’s like to work here better than anyone, and their relationship with a candidate means they know more than we can learn during an interview process.

We offer a $1,000.00 bonus to any current employee from whose recommendation we hire a new full-time employee, within the following guidelines:

* The referral date can’t be earlier than the date the job is posted.
* The referred employee must be hired within 45 days of the initial referral. 
* The referral must represent the candidate’s first contact with Road Warrior Creative.
* Only the first employee to refer a candidate is eligible for a bonus.
* The referred employee must successfully complete their 90 day orientation period.

To make a referral, current employees should send the candidate’s contact information to Chris Hinds, COO, should make an introduction to the candidate, and should expect to be engaged lightly during the recruiting and interview process.  

New hire referral bonuses will be paid following the conclusion of the referred employee's 90 day orientation period.  The referring employee must still be employed by Road Warrior Creative at this time to be eligible for bonus.

## New Client Referrals

__NOTE:__ *Employees with an ownership stake in Road Warrior Creative and employees whose job descriptions are focused on sales and/or aquiring new business are not eligible for this bonus.*

While we certainly do not expect all of our employees to be door-to-door salespeople, Road Warrior Creative does want to show its appreciation for employees who go above and beyond by directly referring us new clients. 

For new client referrals, we offer a referral bonus equal to 10% of the value of their first invoice, up to a maximum total bonus of $500.00, within the following guidelines:

* The new client must engage Road Warrior Creative for paid services within 30 days of the initial referral. 
* The referral must  represent the new client's first contact with Road Warrior Creative.
* Only the first employee to refer a new client is eligible for a bonus. 

To make a referral, employees should send the prospective client's information to Chris Hinds, COO, should make an introduction to the referral, and should expect to be engaged lightly throughout the new client onboarding process. 

New client referral bonuses will be paid within 90 day(s) of the new client's first invoice being paid in full. The referring employee must still be employed by Road Warrior Creative on the date that the new client's first invoice is paid in full.
