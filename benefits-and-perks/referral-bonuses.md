# Referral Bonuses

## New Hire Referrals

__NOTE:__ *Employees with an ownership stake in Road Warrior Creative are not eligible for this bonus.*

Support from a current employee is one of the best signals as to whether or not prospect candidates will be successful at our company. Our employees understand Road Warrior Creative's needs and what it’s like to work here better than anyone, and their relationship with a candidate means they know more than we can learn during an interview process.

We offer a $1,000.00 bonus to any current employee from whose recommendation we hire a new employee, within the following guidelines:

* The referral date can’t be earlier than the date the job is posted.
* The referral must represent the candidate’s first contact with Road Warrior Creative.
* Should multiple employees refer the same candidate, only the first employee to refer is eligible for a bonus.
* The referred employee must be hired within 60 days of the initial referral. 
* The referred employee must remain in good standing for their first 90 days.

To make a referral, current employees should send the candidate’s contact information to Chris Hinds, COO, should make an introduction to the candidate, and should expect to be engaged lightly during the recruiting and interview process.  

New hire referral bonuses will be paid following the conclusion of the referred employee's 90 day orientation period.  The referring employee must still be employed by Road Warrior Creative at this time to be eligible for bonus.

## New Client Referrals

__NOTE:__ *Employees with an ownership stake in Road Warrior Creative and employees whose job descriptions are focused on sales and/or acquiring new business are not eligible for this bonus.*

Every employee is eligible to join our Referral Partner Program for the duration of their time working at Road Warrior Creative. Here is how the program works:

For the 12 months following an employee referral's close date, we will pass on 10% of every dollar paid to Road Warrior Creative as a bonus on the employee's paycheck. Alternatively, the employee can request that we donate the proceeds to a nonprofit/foundation of their choice (excluding political or religious organizations).

__Interested in joining?__ Ask Chris Hinds, COO to provide you with a sign-up link.
