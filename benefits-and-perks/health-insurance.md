# Health Insurance

Road Warrior Creative recognizes the importance of having great medical coverage.

So long as the company meets the minimum number of enrolled employees to qualify, Road Warrior Creative will continue to offer medical, dental, and vision coverage for employees and their dependents. Road Warrior Creative will offer employees one plan option, for which it will contribute a flat $125.00 per month. For employees that choose to waive medical coverage under a company plan, Road Warrior Creative will provide the same $125.00 as a monthly lifestyle allowance. Should an employee elect to choose his/her own medical coverage OR if Road Warrior Creative lacks the minimum number of enrolled employees to qualify for a company insurance policy, employees and company officers will be solely responsible for finding and paying for any such coverage out-of-pocket. 

Company officers that choose to waive medical coverage are not eligible for the lifestyle allowance.

Subject to the above terms, full-time employees are eligible for health insurance coverage beginning on the first day of the month following their hire date, or if they experience a Qualifying Life Event as defined by [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/qualifying-life-event/).
