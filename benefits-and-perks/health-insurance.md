# Health Insurance

Road Warrior Creative recognizes the importance of having great medical coverage. So long as the company meets the minimum enrollment as established by our Professional Employer Organization (PEO), the company will continue to offer medical, dental, and vision coverage for qualifying employees and their dependents.

Road Warrior Creative will select and attempt to enroll in a group health insurance plan in Q4 of every calendar year. 

## Coverage Options and Contributions

Subject to the above terms, Road Warrior Creative will offer up to four plan options with the following company contribution levels:

Coverage Type/Level | Employee | Dependent(s)
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Medical | 75% Company 25% Employee | Employee Pays Difference
Dental | 50% Company 50% Employee | Employee Pays Difference
Vision | 0% Company 100% Employee | Employee Pays Difference

Employees can access full plan features and information inside their employee dashboard.

## Alternative Coverage Plan

If at any time Road Warrior Creative fails to secure coverage for employees, the company's alternative coverage plan will go into effect. Employees do not need to do anything to enroll in this plan.

Qualifying employees will receive a flat Lifestyle Allowance of $200 each month. This allowance is intended to help employees with their personal expenses until the company can successfully reapply for coverage.

## Enrollment

There is no waiting period to enroll in health benefits. An existing employee may change their enrollment status during the annual open enrollment period or if they experience a Qualifying Life Event as defined by [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/qualifying-life-event/). Employees choosing to waive available coverage are not entitled to cash payments in lieu, for any reason.
