# Health Insurance

Road Warrior Creative recognizes the importance of offering our employees great medical coverage.

So long as the company meets the minimum number of enrolled employees to qualify, Road Warrior Creative will continue to offer medical, dental, and vision coverage for employees and their dependents. Road Warrior Creative will offer employees one plan option, for which it will contribute a flat $125.00 per month. For employees that choose to waive medical coverage, Road Warrior Creative will provide a $100.00 monthly Lifestyle Bonus. If employees wish to source their own medical coverage, they will be solely responsible for finding and paying for any such coverage out-of-pocket. 

Full-time employees are eligible for health insurance coverage beginning on the first day of the month following their hire date, or if they experience a Qualifying Life Event as defined by [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/qualifying-life-event/).
