# Health Insurance

Road Warrior Creative recognizes the importance of having great medical coverage. So long as the company meets the minimum enrollment as established by our insurance provider, the company will continue to offer medical, dental, and vision coverage for qualifying employees and their dependents. 

Road Warrior Creative will select and attempt to enroll in a group health insurance plan in Q4 of every calendar year. 

## Coverage Options and Contributions

Subject to the above terms, Road Warrior Creative will offer three plan options with the following company contribution levels:

Coverage Type/Level | Employee | Dependent(s)
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Bronze 6650/100 | 30% Company 70% Employee | 100% Employee
Silver 6000/80 | Employee Pays Difference | 100% Employee
Gold 2500/80 | Employee Pays Difference | 100% Employee
Dental/vision | 30% Company 70% Employee | 100% Employee

## Alternative Coverage Plan

If at any time Road Warrior Creative fails to meet minimum enrollment quotas and is unable to secure coverage for employees, the company's alternative coverage plan will go into effect. Employees do not need to do anything to enroll in this plan.

Qualifying employees will receive a flat Lifestyle Allowance of $125 each month. This allowance is intended to help employees with their personal expenses until the company can successfully reapply for coverage.

## Enrollment

Qualifying employees may enroll on the first day of the month 30 days after their hire date, or if they experience a Qualifying Life Event as defined by [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/qualifying-life-event/). Employees choosing to waive available coverage are not entitled to cash payments in lieu, for any reason.
