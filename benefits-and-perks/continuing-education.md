# Continuing Education

We believe that sharing knowledge builds loyalty. Empowering and educating people builds trust and fuels long-term partnerships, whether that be with a client or an employee. Helping people to learn and grow is a core part of what we do!

__Here is how we do it:__

## Financial Support

Road Warrior Creative is committed to financially supporting employees who want to pursue learning activities related to their work for our company. There are two main ways in which we do this:

1. Employees may use regular paid work hours to pursue learning projects. 

	Though learning projects should not take priority over billable work (unless the employee is otherwise instructed by his/her direct supervisor), employees are encouraged to spend their paid work hours reading, listening to podcasts, or working on side projects that will help them to develop skills relevant to their position. 

2. Direct reimbursement for costs associated with formal learning opportunities.

	We believe there can be great value in attending/participating in workshops, classes, and conferences.  Reimbursement for costs associated with these activities, including registration, materials fees, and/or travel expenses may be available to employees.  To inquire about financial support for specific educational pursuit(s), employees should have a discussion with their supervisor about the specific opportunity, associated costs, and the direct impact of any new knowledge or skills acquired on Road Warrior Creative's business. __In order to qualify, an Educational Expense Approval Form must be filled out for each expense and signed by the employee's supervisor. Employees who receive such reimbursement(s) will be subject to the following terms:__

	* The employee agrees to share receipt(s), registration document(s), diploma(s) or certificate(s), or other material(s) with Road Warrior Creative in order to prove their enrollment in and completion of the course they are receiving reimbursement for. Employee agrees to refund the entire amount of educational expenses in the event that employee fails to provide reasonable proof within five (5) days of a written request from their supervisor. Any materials shared will be held in strict confidence.
	* If the employee personally receives a tuition or materials refund for any reason, the employee agrees to give the full refund amount to the company via personal check within five (5) business days of receipt.
	* If the employee voluntarily terminates their employment with Road Warrior Creative prior to completing the course, the employee agrees to refund the entire amount of educational expenses provided for said course.
	* If the employee voluntarily terminates their employment with Road Warrior Creative within six (6) months of completing the course, the employee agrees to refund 75% of the educational expenses provided for said course.
	* If the employee voluntarily terminates their employment with Road Warrior Creative after completion of the course and completion of six (6) months active employment, but prior to completing twelve (12) consecutive months of active employment, the employee agrees to refund a pro-rated share of the educational expenses provided for said course. This pro-rated share will be calcuated by dividing the total amount of educational expenses provided by the percentage of time left in months from one year that the employee did not continue working. (_For example, if you receive $1000 of educational reimbursement and work only nine months after completion of the course, you will refund 25% of the $1000 or $250._)
	* After completing the course and completing twelve (12) consecutive months of active employment, the employee's obligations under these terms will be fulfilled. 

## Mentoring and Networking Opportunities

We encourage employees to become involved in activities within their local communities which will help them to learn, grow and connect with other professionals. As needed, Road Warrior Creative can take an active role in helping interested employees connect with other professionals in their area or to identify relevant organizations and groups that will enhance employees' professional development. Although employees are not *required* to disclose their status as a part of Road Warrior Creative's team, we believe that doing so creates new opportunities both for the company and for the employee. 

## Support for Speaking Engagements

When an employee of Road Warrior Creative speaks publicly about their area of expertise, it makes our entire team look great! Employees who hold workshops or lectures while clearly representing themselves as part of the Road Warrior Creative team, are eligible for up to $500.00 of reimbursement for materials and travel expenses per calendar year. 

Eligibility for such reimbursement(s) must be reviewed on a per-case basis by the employee's direct supervisor, in advance. Ideally, video or audio footage of the speaking engagement should be made available.
