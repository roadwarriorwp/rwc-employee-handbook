#Continuing Education

We believe that sharing knowledge builds loyalty. Empowering and educating people builds trust and fuels long-term partnerships, whether that be with a client or an employee. Helping people to learn and grow is a core part of what we do!

__Here is how we do it:__

##Financial Support

Road Warrior Creative is committed to financially supporting employees who want to pursue learning activities related to their work for our company. There are two main ways in which we do this:

1. Employees may use regular paid work hours to pursue learning projects. 

	Though learning projects should not take priority over billable work (unless the employee is otherwise instructed by his/her direct supervisor), employees are encouraged to spend their paid work hours reading, listening to podcasts, or working on side projects that will help them to develop skills relevant to their position. 

2. Direct reimbursement for costs associated with formal learning opportunities.

	We believe there can be great value in attending/participating in workshops, classes, and conferences.  Upfront payment or reimbursement for costs associated with these activities, including registration, materials fees, and/or travel expenses may be available to employees.  To inquire about financial support for specific educational pursuit(s), employees should have a discussion with their supervisor about the specific opportunity, associated costs, and the direct impact of any new knowledge or skills aquired on Road Warrior Creative's business.

##Mentoring and Networking Opportunities

We encourage employees to become involved in activities within their local communites which will help them to learn, grow and connect with other professionals. As needed, Road Warrior Creative can take an active role in helping interested employees connect with other professionals in their area or to identify relevant organizations and groups that will enhance employees' professional development. Although employees are not *required* to disclose their status as a part of Road Warrior Creative's team, we believe that doing so creates new opportunities both for the company and for the employee. 

##Support for Speaking Engagements

When an employee of Road Warrior Creative speaks publicly about their area of expertise, it makes our entire team look great! Employees who hold workshops or lectures while clearly representing themselves as part of the Road Warrior Creative team, are eligible for up to $500.00 of reimbursement for materials and travel expenses per calendar year. 

Eligibility for such reimbursement(s) must be reviewed on a per-case basis by the employee's direct supervisor, in advance. Ideally, video or audio footage of the speaking engagement should be made available.
