#Continuing Education

We believe that sharing knowledge builds loyalty. Empowering and educating people builds trust and fuels long-term partnerships, whether that be with a client or an employee. Helping people to learn and grow is a core part of what we do!

__Here is how we do it:__

##Financial Support

Road Warrior Creative is committed to financially supporting employees that want to pursue learning activities related to the work they do for our company. Employees may use regular work hours to pursue learning projects, though this should not take priority over billable work, unless the employee is otherwise instructed by his/her direct supervisor. Additional financial support may be made available after a broader discussion with the employee about specific educational pursuit(s) and the direct impact of the new knowledge or skills aquired on the business.

##Mentoring and Networking Opportunities

We encourage our employees to become involved in activities within their local communites that help them to learn, grow and connect with other internet professionals. Road Warrior Creative will take an active role in helping interested employees to connect with other professionals in their area, in order to enhance employees' professional development. Although they are not *required* to disclose their status as an employee of Road Warrior Creative at such events, we believe that doing so creates new opportunities both for the company and for the employee. 

##Support for Speaking Engagements

When an employee of Road Warrior Creative speaks publicly about their area of expertise, it makes our entire team look great! Employees that hold workshops or lectures while clearly representing themselves as a Road Warrior Creative employee, are eligible for up to $500.00 of reimbursement for flight and hotel expenses per calendar year. 

Eligibility for such reimbursement(s) must be reviewed on a per-case basis by the employee's direct supervisor, in advance. Ideally, video or audio footage of the speaking engagement should be made available.
