# Qualifying for Benefits

Subject to the approval of our Professional Employer Organization (PEO), __ALL__ Road Warrior Creative employees will be eligible for the same benefits regardless of their full-time or part-time status. 

In the event that our relationship with a Professional Employer Organization (PEO) prevents us from offering the same benefits to all employees, Road Warrior Creative will take reasonable steps to inform impacted employees of the change and update this policy accordingly.

An employee's full-time or part-time status is determined by what is listed in their signed offer letter. Employees who believe they may need their work status updated or checked should contact Chris Hinds, COO immediately.
