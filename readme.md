#Road Warrior Creative, LLC Open Source Employee Handbook

##About this Handbook

The beauty of the web and open source is that now *anyone* can see how we run our company, no matter where they are. You're looking at the central repository for how Road Warrior Creative conducts its day-to-day operations. 

Why did we decide to make our employee handbook open source? We believe in transparent and honest business practices, from the ground up -- and that includes being open about who we are and how we treat the design, marketing, and web experts across the United States that make up our team. These are the values that we're committed to promoting and practicing:

* __We believe quality of life matters.__
	* Our employees can live anywhere and work everywhere.
	* Quality of work produced is valued over hours clocked.
	* Work should be fun and challenging.
	* We do not put profits above people, relationships, or self-care.
* __We believe sharing knowledge builds loyalty.__
	* Education and training are a core component of what we do.
	* We create tools and solutions that give control back to the client. 
	* Empowering and educating people builds trust and fuels long-term partnerships.
* __We believe in growing relationships, not transactions.__
	* In every interaction, we strive to increase long-term value and impact.
	* Big or small, each new project is the start of an ongoing partnership.
	* Putting people first: We seek to connect with clients and employees on a human level.
* __We believe the 9-5 is dead.__
	* The internet and social media don't have set business hours -- and neither do we!
	* A business built on the internet needs to be fluid and responsive, whether it's 2pm *or 2am*.
	* There's also perks: Taking afternoons off to watch a school play and weekends camping in the woods!
* __We believe in giving back to our community.__
	* Community can be local, or wherever we do business across the US. 
	* We donate annually to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Allied Women Entrepreneurs, Girls Who Code, and Child's Play.
	* 501c3 nonprofits receive a blanket 20% discount for all services.
	* Every July, we build one *100% FREE* website for a nonprofit organization nominated by our audience.
* __We believe "someday" is not a day of the week.__
	* We set goals and we meet them.
	* We don't let fear of failure hold us back.
	* We take risks and try new things.
	* We can always be more, be better and we can always grow. 

Like the internet, our business is in a constant state of change -- we're always trying to improve our internal processes. A big part of that falls on updating and maintaining this handbook: __We actively encourage all feedback and suggestions on ways that we should modify or improve this document.__
